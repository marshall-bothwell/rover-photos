## Search Mars Rover Photos

This app provides a user interface to search for photos from the four Mars rovers NASA has launched in the past two decades.

It abstracts the process of making an API call to NASA's Mars Rover Photos API, simplifying searching for photos from a specific rover on a specific date.

Additionally, it uses NASA's manifests API to restrict searches on dates or sols where photos are not available.

As a result, this app will continue to allow searches for the most recent rover photos as NASA uploads them, and will guide the user to search only dates where photos are available.
